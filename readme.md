# PowerBI - Ngokaf Trans Project : Customer Loyalty

## Summary

This decision-making project was initiated as part of our end-of-study project (TFC) in the Information Systems Management degree [^1]. The aim was to provide the decision-making sphere with a dashboard (designed using the **GIMSI®** method [^2]) with a view to building customer loyalty in the goods and passenger transport sector.

This project is based on several data, the most important of which are :

- Customer opinions on the services offered
- Customer geolocation
- Customers' bus routes
